There are a few ways to stream music with python. 
One way is to use the built-in module “musicplayer”. 
This module allows you to play MP3 files. 
You can also use the “pygame” module to play WAV files.


We can play, split, merge, and customize our wav audio files by using the playsound and pydub libraries. 
You can play audio files in almost any format using the snack sound kit, including WAV, AU, AIFF, MP3, CSL, SD, SMP, and NIST/Sphere.

Python is an extremely popular programming language for software development, 
making it suitable for music streaming. There are numerous libraries that simplify this process, 
including Pymps and MusicPlayer. Music servers use graphical clients such as Pymserv to manage their files.
